Outcome: client learns to focus on their big rocks (important priorities) before the minor pebbles and sand of daily demands, leading to better productivity and life balance.",

The client identifies their own big rocks – the crucial goals or values (family time, critical project, health, etc.). Using a visual worksheet or just discussion, they map out how to put those first in their schedule. For instance, scheduling workouts or family dinners (big rocks) before emails or chores (sand).

Outcome: better time allocation – more focus on important strategic activities, and minimization of distractions and procrastination.",
                method: "The coach introduces the 4-quadrant matrix: Important & Urgent, Important & Not Urgent, Not Important & Urgent, Not Important & Not Urgent. The client sorts their tasks or typical activities into these categories. Often they realize many urgent tasks (emails, minor requests) are not truly important. The coach then guides them to plan more time for Quadrant II – important but not urgent (like long-term projects, self-care) – and delegate or eliminate Quadrant III/IV tasks (unimportant ones). By becoming aware of how they currently spend time, clients can consciously make changes (e.g. set boundaries on interruptions, schedule deep work). This tool is frequently used in corporate or executive coaching but is equally helpful for personal life management.",

Useful for finding patterns, unresolved issues, or values emerging from life experiences. Outcome: a big-picture perspective on one life journey, leading to insights about identity, values, limiting beliefs, and defining moments.",
                method: "The client creates a visual timeline of their life, noting key events and periods (both positive and negative) that feel important to them. This can be drawn as a line graph with peaks and valleys or simply a chronological list. Crucially, the focus is on events meaningful to the client, not just conventional milestones. As they map it, patterns often emerge (e.g. I notice all my career successes coincided with times I felt personally supported or Many of my low points involve that same limiting belief). In the session, the coach and client discuss these events and what they meant to the client.

                purpose: "Facilitate emotional release and clarity in relationships by expressing thoughts/feelings in writing, without the pressure of a real conversation. Ideal for clients holding onto anger, grief, or unspoken words toward someone. Outcome: relief from emotional burden, improved understanding of one feelings, and readiness (if appropriate) to address the relationship more calmly.",
                method: "The client writes a raw, honest letter to a specific person (e.g. a parent, ex-partner, boss) or even a part of themselves – but does not send it. The coach encourages them to pour out everything: frustrations, gratitude, apologies, etc., with no filter. This private writing serves as a cathartic release. In the next session, the client may share parts of the letter or simply discuss the process and insights gained. Often, writing the letter helps the client identify what truly bothers them or what they truly want, beyond initial anger. It gets the heaviness out of the way. After this, the coach and client can strategize how to move forward – whether that's having a constructive conversation with the person (now that emotions are settled) or finding closure privately.",
                timescale: "Homework (writing the letter, usually 30–60 min of personal time). In-session follow-up (client can read it aloud or summarize, ~15+ min, but they are not forced to share if uncomfortable). The exercise can be repeated for different people or situations as needed.",

Borrowed from therapy but used in coaching for perspective shifting and closure. Outcome: increased self-awareness, empathy (even for oneself), and emotional resolution – often leading to decisions or peace regarding a situation.",
                method: "The coach sets up an empty chair facing the client. The client is invited to imagine a person sitting there – it could be someone they need to have a difficult conversation with, or it could represent a part of themselves (like their fearful self, or their inner critic). The coach then facilitates a role-play: the client speaks to the person in the chair, expressing thoughts or feelings they've been holding back. The coach might even have the client switch chairs – to respond as the other person or as their own wiser self – creating a dialogue. This technique helps externalize and process unfinished business. For example, a client might confront an absent parent in the empty chair, finally saying things they needed to say; then switch and attempt to speak from the parent perspective (building empathy or closure). By the end, clients often feel a release of emotion and a better understanding of themselves or the other party. Coaches use it carefully, ensuring the client is ready and debriefing thoroughly afterward.",

Coaches might instruct clients to be specific (e.g. the warm cup of coffee this morning or my colleague helped me with a task).

For instance, the client might agree to email the coach updates, or the coach might use a shared tracking tool. Some coaches set up accountability texts or interim check-in calls. Another method is a habit tracker or app where the coach can see the client checkmarks for daily habits. The key is setting specific targets (e.g. write 500 words every weekday) and a way to report or review them regularly. Knowing that someone will check (and celebrate or inquire if it's not done) boosts the client commitment. Coaches also help clients strategize rewards or consequences to strengthen accountability.",

Conversely, how can they engage more with the uplifting people? The word detox underlines that it's about cleansing one social circle for better well-being.
