## Key Improvements in This Framework

### ✅ **Functionally Distinct Categories**
- Each category addresses a different type of "stuck"
- Clear problem-solution mapping for intervention selection
- No artificial boundaries or forced merges

### ✅ **Balanced Distribution**
- Largest category (Internal Barriers) reflects reality - most coaching challenges involve overcoming resistance
- No category too small to justify existence
- Natural clustering based on coaching practice

### ✅ **Absorbed Domain-Specific Work**
- **Motivational work** integrated into "Clarify What Matters" (vision creates motivation)
- **Emotional processing** integrated into "Shift Internal Barriers" (emotions often ARE the barriers)
- **Relationship challenges** integrated into "Shift Internal Barriers" (relationship patterns block progress)

### ✅ **Preserved Key Distinctions**
- **Pattern recognition** vs **Self-awareness** remain separate (different coaching moments)
- **Clarity** vs **Action** remain separate (different phases of coaching)
- **Internal barriers** vs **External systems** remain separate (different intervention approaches)
